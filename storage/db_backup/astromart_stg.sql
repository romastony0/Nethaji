Does it signify an actual, literal death or dramatic end? No. You may still go through a similar grieving process, but this death is of the figurative variety. In order for something new to begin, something else has to end. A feeling of liberation will follow.',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','1'),(26,'Love','Death','Transformation is eminent. Through Death comes new life, and although there is an ending in sight, it will give you a chance to gain something new: perspective, consciousness, a better or new relationship, etc. Once you accept that all things must experience endings or changes in order for new things to begin, the healing progress can start and you can take the first step on your new journey.',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','1'),(27,'Love','Death','You may have done some things that you aren\'t proud of lately, but the Death card shows that a new you is about to emerge.

Try not to be defensive.',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','1'),(38,'Love','Temperance','Temperance is a card that symbolizes moderation, so if you\'ve been indulging a bit too much in your love life, it\'s time to tone things down. You don\'t have to show a lot charisma, wit, and sex appeal to prove that you have substance. Do what\'s necessary to obtain that elusive balance in your love life. No effort, no matter how small, goes unrewarded.',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','1'),(39,'Love','Temperance','You\'ve had your share of fun, and now it\'s time to face the consequences. You probably knew what you were doing when you did it, but now that it\'s time to pay the piper, you may have serious regrets.

The decision is easy.',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','1'),(40,'Love','Justice','Be an impartial observer in your own love life today. Instead of complaining that things aren\'t fair, try to be honest and loyal even if you don\'t get the same in return. Serve as a peacemaker.

The appearance of the Justice card is a huge boost, though, because it\'s a sign that everything is about to turn around. The Universe is about balance, so for every bad experience you have you can expect a good one eventually. The scale is about to tip in your favor.',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','1'),(43,'Love','The Moon','The Moon guides your emotions and subconscious, and the appearance of this card shows that you are ready to trust yourself and overcome your romantic fears today. What are you most afraid of? Put your imagination and creative talents to work in order to come up with productive solutions to your problems. Pay attention to dream imagery (sleeping and daydreaming) and what your subconscious is trying to communicate.',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','1'),(44,'Love','The Moon','Look at both sides of the situations you encounter today. The Moon represents illusions and the gray areas that we are unsure of, but being afraid to face the unknown will only lead to more uncertainty.

Gurus can wear many disguises, but it doesn\'t lessen their knowledge.',NULL,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','1'),(57,'Love','The Pope','Your love life is very structured right now. The Pope symbolizes traditional morals, values, etc., so you aren\'t willing to go too far out of the norm in order to snag or please a love interest.

Cupid\'s arrow follows the same path as your subconscious, and you\'re sure to hit a romantic bull\'s-eye when you trust your instincts. Love at first sight is not only possible, but it\'s probable.
