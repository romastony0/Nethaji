While investing in new tools, clothes, or accessories may help you feel like you\'re heading in a new direction, true change comes from within. Luckily, you\'ll have a chance to honestly examine your life when the Aquarius moon cozies up to Saturn, helping you close doors and move away from situations or behaviors holding you back. You\'ll feel more optimistic as the day comes to a close and the moon makes its debut in your sign.'),(1014,'2023-01-06',12,'horoscope','You will fit in perfectly with just about every situation you encounter today, Pisces.

If something needs to be done meticulously and efficiently, you\'re the one for the job'),(1015,'2023-01-06',12,'horoscope','Flex the muscles of your helping hands. You may be in particularly charitable spirits today as the moon links up with grounded Saturn in your twelfth house of healing. Your urge to give time, money or advice to a loved one in need is admirable, but don’t cross the line between compassion and fostering codependence. And remember, ‘ giving one: Generosity is a two-way street. When you let someone help you, you’re giving THEM the gift of good karma!'),(1016,'2023-01-07',12,'horoscope','Your community will acknowledge you as a rising star this morning, dear Fish, as the moon travels through your sign and blows a kiss to the sun. Use this energy to step into your extroverted side, nurturing your image through pleasantries and social exchange. Unfortunately, the vibe will get a little rough later in the afternoon when Luna squares off with Mars. These vibes are poised to heighten your emotions, marking a good time to unplug and hide away at home. Meanwhile, Venus shares a sweet exchange with Neptune, allowing you to feel the love from your friends far and wide. '),(1017,'2023-01-07',12,'horoscope','What a great day for you! You seem to have the innate listening abilities of a therapist or counselor. Everyone comes to you with their problems or to cry on your proverbial shoulder.

Perhaps today will make you think about it.'),(1018,'2023-01-07',12,'horoscope','Why yes, they ARE checking you out, Pisces. The moon beams in your sign today, turning up the dial on your charisma. Even if you’re feeling a tad self-conscious, don\'t pull a classic Pisces disappearing act. Single Fish can reel in an adoring new admirer simply by paying them your full attention. (You can be positively hypnotic when you choose to turn on the charm.) Don’t underestimate how much you add to your existing social circles. There’s nothing to prepare. Just show up and be fully engaged with whatever’s going on!'),(1019,'2023-01-08',12,'horoscope','You\'ll feel energized, creative, and beloved today, dear Pisces, as the moon continues to travel through your sign. Use this energy to nurture your goals and personal agendas, as the universe will be eager to open up pathways. Pay attention to your creative thoughts when Luna cozies up to Neptune this afternoon, helping you align with your spirituality and artistic self.

But don\'t let things get too out of hand. It isn\'t often that you allow yourself this little bit of narcissism. Everything you say will be pertinent, and people will let you know. For once, the stars are giving you the opportunity to cater to your own ego, so take advantage of it!'),(1021,'2023-01-08',12,'horoscope','A little burst of momentum comes your way today, courtesy of the Pisces moon. If you’ve been waffling about next steps, this may provide the necessary nudge to at least take the first action step toward a daunting goal. Of course you WANT to make a change, Pisces, but there are underlying reasons you haven’t. Sometimes we need someone to lead the way or to lean on until we get traction. This might be a therapist, coach or support group. Acknowledging you need a little help is actually a sign of tremendous strength, not to mention wisdom.'),(1022,'2023-01-09',12,'horoscope','A prosperous energy will find you today, darling Pisces, as the Aries moon and lucky Jupiter align in the sector of your chart that governs money. Work with these vibes by boldly pursuing monetary success, and be sure to work with positive mantras, while carrying your favorite money-drawing stones. Meanwhile, Mercury and Venus hold hands in Capricorn, asking you to lift up your community with positive words and compassion.

Social Mercury flips into retrograde today, backing up through your communal eleventh house until January 18. While that might not sound like toast-worthy news, there’s a hidden opportunity tucked in this nostalgic three-week cycle. Friends from your past could come out of the woodwork—perhaps you’ll add them as latecomers to your weekend guest list? In early 2023, there’s no need to reinvent any wheels for your winter fun. Circle back with organizations and extracurriculars that you enjoyed being a part of in the past. They’ll greet you with open arms'),(1025,'2023-01-10',12,'horoscope','Remember to pace yourself today, dear Pisces, as the moon continues its journey through fiery Aries and your solar second house. Though you\'ll feel eager to handle your business and finish tasks, moving hastily could cause you to disconnect from the present moment. Take a few moments for solitude as Luna blows a kiss to Saturn, encouraging quiet and introspection. You should be mindful of who you surround yourself with later tonight, as a harsh square between the moon and Mercury could lead to major miscommunications and drama. These vibes also suggest it may be a good evening to unplug, lest you find yourself in an online feud.'),(1026,'2023-01-10',12,'horoscope',' Intense emotions are apt to dominate the scene today, Pisces. Don\'t do anything halfway. It\'s time to give it your all or nothing. You have the power to cut to the heart of the issue. Don\'t hesitate. If you meet opposition, stay strong.

If you\'re being true to yourself, you should have no trouble overcoming any obstacle that stands in your path.'),(1027,'2023-01-10',12,'horoscope','Admit it, Pisces: You prefer starting projects to finishing them, and with your meandering mind, you\'re easily distracted. Yet those loose ends can weigh on you, obstructing mental space. Take inventory today as the year is officially almost over. Which of these seeds of genius are worth cultivating in 2023 and which would be better off put on indefinite hold? It wouldn’t hurt to pack away supplies that you won’t be using for a while.

This is also a fine idea because (sad trombone) Mercury WILL be going retrograde from December 29 to January 18. So you might as well get a running start on this while your head is clear. Whether it’s a wish list, first draft mission statement or half-done vision board, keep it somewhere you can see it and re-motivate yourself every day. Then, plan to pick it up again with the first new moon of 2023, on January 21. Do you need some support in reaching your objectives?
